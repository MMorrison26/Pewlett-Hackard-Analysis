# Preparing for Retirement
## Pewlett Hackard Analysis
### *Overview*
In considering how many positions will be available given the upcoming "silver tsunami" of retiring employees, Pewlett Hackard is looking for some specific analysis regarding how many employees are retiring *by title* as well as any employees who would be eligible to participate in a mentorship program. In this way, HR can prepare not only for open requisitions but also for valued, knowledgable veterans of the company who can help train the next generation of hired employees.
### *Results*
* There's a significant 90,398 employees who are eligible for retirement. (See Figure A below.)
* There are a respectable 1,549 employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program. (See Figure B below.)
* The Senior Staff (31%) and Senior Engineer (32%) titles account for roughly two thirds of the retirees.
* Luckily, only 2 "Managers" are retiring, so there can be necessary focus to replace those roles while solid leadership remains in place.

### *Summary*
When considering how many roles needs to be filled, we have to remember that regular turnover will continue to happen in addition to the 90,398 eligible employees may be retiring. Hewlett Packard needs to be prepared to offer retirement packages to all eligible employees, but not everyone may want to retire right when they are eligible. It would behoove the company to begin discussions to see who is interested or not interested in accepting those offers. By looking at prior "waves" of retirement, the company can begin to predict how many may retire this time around. Combined with ongoing updates on other staffing risks/promotions, they can hone in on exactly how many roles will need to be filled.

The amount of employees eligible for the mentorship program are drastically less than the estimated number of roles that will need to be filled. The good news is training and onboarding can be done in groups or classes. It doesn't all need to be one-on-one mentoring. Even taking that into consideration, however, that leaves about 58 new hires per mentor to take under their wing. Some employees can be promoted within the company, which can reduce the training hours and hand-holding required, but the company may want to consider hiring sooner rather than later to take advantage of the retiring employees while they're still here to mentor and train.

As far as additional queries that might help with this transition, it might be useful to know the tenure of the employees staying with the company who aren't eligible for retirement. This gives an idea if there are employees who have been with the company less than 1 year that might still require closer supervision versus employees who are established and might be able to step to help mentor even if they were born after 1965. <br />
