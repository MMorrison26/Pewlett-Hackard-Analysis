# Preparing for Retirement
## Pewlett Hackard Analysis
### *Overview*
In considering how many positions will be available given the upcoming "silver tsunami" of retiring employees, Pewlett Hackard is looking for some specific analysis regarding how many employees are retiring *by title* as well as any employees who would be eligible to participate in a mentorship program. In this way, HR can prepare not only for open requisitions but also for valued, knowledgable veterans of the company who can help train the next generation of hired employees.
### *Results*
* There's a significant 90,398 employees who are eligible for retirement. (See Figure A below.)
* There are a respectable 1,549 employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program. (See Figure B below.)
* The Senior Staff (31%) and Senior Engineer (32%) titles account for roughly two thirds of the retirees.
* Luckily, only 2 "Managers" are retiring, so there can be necessary focus to replace those roles while solid leadership remains in place.
